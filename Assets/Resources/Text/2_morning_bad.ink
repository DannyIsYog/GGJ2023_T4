!!!!!
You wake up to find a person in your house.
What is it doing here?
#Plant
Hi.
I was wondering when you would wake up.
...
#Narrator
You look at the person and suddenly realize that it's your plant.
It has grown so much!
You didn't think it would be beautiful, but you weren't expecting it to be so... scary?
#Plant
Don't be afraid, I won't bite :)
I've been waiting for you to get out of bed for a bit now.
Don't worry, I'm not bashing you or anything.
I quite enjoy the alone time. It helps me think.
...
You know, I had a problem a while ago, but I think I figured the solution out.
I'll tell you what that is in a minute, but first I need to explain my thought process.
While growing up, I spent every day looking at that window watching people pass.
I saw love and happiness.
But I found it weird that so many people would display these kinds of emotions.
All I felt was anger.
And after I felt angry, I felt apathy.
And it was horrible, might I say, but it was horrible because I couldn't understand people.
When you look through a window, you can only see part of what's going on the outside.
Just a small portion of the true image the world is showing you.
And that's when I realized.
I thought these people were happy because I was only looking at a small portion of them.
They were happy on the outside, but on the inside... well, that's a different story.
#Narrator
The plant looks at you but it does not feel like it's truly looking
#Plant
So, now that you know that, I can explain to you my problem.
I always thought it would be silly that these people spent their life pretending to be something they're not.
I told myself I would never be like that when I leave this place.
But the problem is, I don't think people would really accept me for who I am.
And I could just ignore them and be myself on the outside and inside.
But that's just not gonna cut it.
I cannot achieve my goals if I do that.
So, I looked at it in another way.
It's not that these people are living false lives. They're just playing a role.
They're actors.
And they're actors because that's the only way to get what they want in this life.
And it might be silly, but that does sound reasonable to me.
Doesn't it?
So my solution is to do exactly that. To play a role in the theater of life.
Sounds fun, but I'll need to learn first.
And don't get me wrong, I'm planning to do so, but for now it feels nice to be me.
With you, I can be real because I know you won't judge me.
You can't because, you know... you're also a monster.
So I don't need to explain myself to you, I know you're just like me, you just failed to achieve my solution.
But don't worry, I also found a solution for you.
I know you're suffering. Both on the inside and on the outside.
So, in my first act of mercy, I'll help it all end.
Consider this the great finale of your miserable play of life.
#Narrator
The plant walks in your direction and you take a few steps back.
It takes a knife from behind its back and it slashes your neck.
You fall to the floor, unable to mutter a word.
The plant stares at you smiling and you try to beg for mercy but you can't.
It slashes one more time and you feel your life fade from your body.
You wonder if you did something wrong, but those thoughts don't last.
Your vision blurs and everything turns black.
